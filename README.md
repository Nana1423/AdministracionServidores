Server administration refers to the management and maintenance of an organization's servers, which involves ensuring they are functioning properly, kept up-to-date, and secure. Server administrators are responsible for configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting servers, as well as ensuring they are available to end-users at all times. Additionally, they are also responsible for implementing security measures to protect critical data and systems within the organization.
